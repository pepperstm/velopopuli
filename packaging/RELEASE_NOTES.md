**VeloPopuli — the people's indoor ride.** Ride real GPX routes in 3D on your smart trainer. Free and open source. [velopopuli.com](https://velopopuli.com) · [Guides](https://github.com/pepperstm/velopopuli/wiki)

> This is an early release. The 3D world, physics, workouts and progress tracking are well tested; real trainers and sensors are only now being tried, and the Windows and Linux builds have had little use. If something doesn't work, the app's **Report a problem → Report on GitHub** builds a diagnostics report for you — please send one.

## What's new in 0.3.6

- **Barriers lean with the road.** On a hill each barrier section now stands on its feet at both ends and tilts with the slope, instead of standing level and floating or sinking.
- **Denser woods, and six kinds of tree.** Mapped forests are planted much more thickly, with spruce, pine, broadleaf, birch, tall columnar trees and bushes, mixed by latitude, altitude (conifers take over towards the tree line) and stands that change across a wood.
- **Distant trees as sprites.** Beyond about 200 m a tree is drawn as a flat picture of itself and becomes a 3D model as you get closer, so the denser woods cost only a little more to draw than the old sparse ones.
- The README and guides have fresh screenshots from this version.

## Download

| System | File | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **macOS** (Apple Silicon and Intel, 10.15+) | `VeloPopuli_*_universal.dmg` | Drag to Applications. Not notarised yet: the first time, open **System Settings → Privacy & Security → Open Anyway** (or run `xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine /Applications/VeloPopuli.app`). |
| **Windows** 10/11 (64-bit) | `VeloPopuli_*_x64-setup.exe` or `VeloPopuli_*_x64_en-US.msi` | Not code-signed yet: if SmartScreen warns, choose **More info → Run anyway**. ANT+ sticks need the WinUSB driver ([Zadig](https://zadig.akeo.ie)). |
| **Ubuntu / Debian** (and Mint, Pop!_OS…; 64-bit) | `VeloPopuli_*_amd64.deb` | `sudo apt install ./VeloPopuli_*_amd64.deb` — installs the ANT+ stick permission rule too. |
| **Arch Linux** (and Manjaro, EndeavourOS…) | `velopopuli-bin-*-x86_64.pkg.tar.zst` | `sudo pacman -U velopopuli-bin-*.pkg.tar.zst`. The `PKGBUILD` is attached too. Install `bluez` for Bluetooth. |
| **Any other Linux** (64-bit) | `VeloPopuli_*_amd64.AppImage` | `chmod +x` and run. |

**Group-ride relay** (optional, for hosting rides with friends): `velopopuli-relay-*` for macOS, Windows and Linux — see [Group rides and self-hosting](https://github.com/pepperstm/velopopuli/wiki/Group-rides-and-self-hosting).
